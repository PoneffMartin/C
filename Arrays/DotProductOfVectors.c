/* 
A Dot product of two vectors is a scalar which is a result of the sum of the product of each of the two vectorsâ€™ members.
For example, if we have the vector [a 1 , a 2 ... a n ] and the vector [b 1 , b 2 ... b n ], their dot product is:
(a 1 b 1 + a 2 b 2 ... + a n b n ). You are given the length n of each of the vectors on the first input line (In order to perform a dot
product of two vectors, they have to be with equal dimensions). On the next n lines, you are given the members of the
first vector, and on the next n ones, the members of the second one.
